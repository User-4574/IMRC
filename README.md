# IMRC
This is a Windows IRC client written in Perl/TK. Its purpose is to monitor an IRC channel for certain strings and popup a custom window when someone enters something that matches a customized string.

To execute the client:
strawberry\perl\bin\wperl.exe imrc.pl
It uses a Linux style configuration file:
strawberry\perl\bin\imrc.conf
